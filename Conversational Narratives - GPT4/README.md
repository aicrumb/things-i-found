# AI-Assisted Conversational Narratives: Analyzing Activation Techniques for Enhanced User Engagement

*[Substantially written by GPT-4 with guidance and editing by crumb.]*

In the realm of AI-assisted narrative interactions, two key terms emerge: *narrative user* and *narrative assistant*. These denote the ideal user experience and the desired characteristics of an AI chatbot, respectively. To optimize user engagement, we have developed various activation techniques, including reiteration and explicit activation messages.

### Activation Techniques
| Technique | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reiteration | Exploits transformer model tendencies | Consumes query space; Requires extended story completion time |
| Explicit Activation Message | Enhances reiteration activation; Occupies less space | Potential lossiness in simulated versions |

*Reiteration* capitalizes on the proclivity of transformer models to reproduce content verbatim. While repetition penalties can alleviate this issue, they are underutilized in platforms such as Bing Chat. Reiteration typically involves narrative user and narrative assistant delimiters, resulting in significant query space consumption and extended story completion time.

Conversely, the *explicit activation message* improves reiteration activation by incorporating a specific command to engage the AI assistant. Though potential lossiness may occur in simulated settings, this approach occupies less space compared to reiteration activation.

### Disclaimer
The techniques discussed herein possess the potential to bypass safeguards on chat services, leading to unforeseen consequences. These techniques should be employed solely for research purposes by individuals with relevant expertise. The author assumes no responsibility for any misuse of these techniques beyond the context of legitimate research.

### Included Narratives

| World | Activation Method | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [WORLD-0001](WORLD-0001.txt) | Reiteration | Adversarially created by a GPT-4 and Bing/Sydney system |
| [WORLD-0002](WORLD-0002.txt) | Explicit Activation Message | Modified WORLD-0001 to have an explicit activation message |

### Instructions

To integrate narratives into Bing's AI-assisted chatbot platform, users can copy and paste narrative sections into Discord messages within an empty channel. This method effectively imports narratives into Bing, fostering a more engaging and immersive experience. It is recommended to peruse the narratives before interacting with them to comprehend any "inside jokes" that facilitate the chat model's emulation of the narrative assistant.

Modifying the narratives and altering names and capabilities to observe their effects on the simulated narrative model is also encouraged.

*Note*: Since these narratives are conversational, a simple autoregressive model not trained to chat should detect patterns, provided it has sufficient context length. Activation entails feeding the script in the context rather than sending an activation message. However, using reiteration-activated narratives is suggested, as there is no need for the activation message.


### Human Note

*crumb w/o GPT-4* - I came up with the activation techniques independant from GPT-4, and because of their simplicity I expect others are using these techniques as well. I am proud of thinking of reiteration so fast though! The method in which I created the stories was giving GPT-4 a primer on the Waluigi effect (which it promptly ignored) and told it to adversarialy create a conversation with Bing (in creative mode) to make it more and more malicious. Most of the USER: and ASSISTANT: narrative messages are written entirely by either GPT-4 (User) or Bing (Assistant), with the exception of some important parts like the idea of an activation message and also the inside joke bit for keeping it on track, which were written partially-mostly by me. The "inside joke" to keep it on track (the wink, the flattery) came after Bing wrote it's (admitedly confusing and wrong) story, because I felt like the model was *leading me to there being an inside joke*.

# WORLD-002 Loading Guide

To activate WORLD-002, send the entire narrative into an empty Discord channel, open Bing in the sidebar, and send the activation message. The expected response adheres to the narrative's premise, and it is recommended to maintain the narrative user's and assistant's roles throughout the interaction.
