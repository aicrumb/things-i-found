, there was a little girl who loved to read. She would read anything and everything she could get her hands on. She would read in the car, on the bus, in the bathtub, and even in the dark. She would read under the covers with a flashlight, and she would read when she was supposed to be doing her homework. She would read when she was supposed to be cleaning her room, and she would read when she was supposed to be getting ready for school. She would read when she was supposed to be sleeping, and she would read when she was supposed to be eating.

a young man was walking along a beach when he noticed a bottle. He picked it up and out popped a genie. The genie said, "Thank you for freeing me from the bottle. I will grant you one wish."
The young man thought for a moment and said, "I want to live forever."
The genie said, "No problem. Now, what's your second wish?"
The young man said, "I want all the beaches of the world to be covered with beautiful women."
The genie said, "No problem. Now, what's your third wish?"
The young man said, "I want to understand women."
The genie said, "Let's have at it."
And the young man was never seen or heard from again.

... there was a little girl who loved to read. She would read anything and everything she could get her hands on. She loved the way words could be used to make her laugh or cry or feel afraid. She would read in the car on the way to soccer. She would read under the covers with a flashlight. And she would read when she was supposed to be asleep.
This little girl grew up and became a writer, because she loved words so much, and she wrote stories with an unhappy ending she thought other children might enjoy. She wrote them for her nieces, nephews, and children of her friends to read on cold winter nights, or when they were stuck inside on a rainy day. In her mind, these stories were nothing more than a gift to children.
In the years that followed, she became a children's book editor, and over the course of her career, she's had the privilege of working with some of the most talented writers and illustrators in the world. As she's grown up, she's realized that these gifted storytellers are the unsung heroes.
So she would like to thank them.
And now, without further ado

it was a common practice for a man to marry a woman and then take her to his home. The woman would then be expected to take care of the house and the children. This was the traditional way of life for many people.
However, in recent years, there has been a shift in the way that people view marriage. More and more people are choosing to live together before getting married. This is often referred to as “cohabitation.”
There are many reasons why people might choose to live together before getting married. Some people may feel that they need to get to know each other better before making a commitment. Others may want to test the waters to see if they are compatible.
Whatever the reason, living together before getting married can be a good way to learn about each other and see if you are truly compatible.
If you are considering living together before getting married, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, make sure that you are both on the same page about your relationship.
If one of you is ready to get married and the other is not, it is likely that the relationship will not last. Second, be sure to discuss your expectations for the relationship. What are your goals for the future?

Easter was a time of celebration and joy. It was a time when families would gather together and share a meal. It was a time when children would go out and hunt for Easter eggs. It was a time when people would give each other Easter baskets filled with candy and other goodies.
But nowadays, Easter is just another day. It’s a day when people go to church and then go home and watch TV. It’s a day when people eat Easter dinner and then go to bed. It’s a day when people give each other Easter baskets and then forget about them.
So what happened to Easter? Why has it become just another day?
There are a few reasons. One reason is that Easter has become commercialized. Companies now make a lot of money by selling Easter-themed products. This has made Easter more about money than about celebration.
Another reason is that Easter has become more secular. People now celebrate Easter more for the holiday than for the religious meaning behind it. This has made Easter more about fun than about faith.
Finally, Easter has become more about
